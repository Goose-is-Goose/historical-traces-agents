00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone! Today I'm excited to show you Historical Traces
An innovative Multi-Agent system for script creation

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In just a few minutes, you'll see how 5 specialized AI agents
work together to create a complete, theater-ready script

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's dive in with a classic Chinese poem theme:
"The Peach Blossom Spring"

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
First, I've already started the system
Opening the browser at localhost:8700

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Here's our workspace interface
On the left, you can see 6 channels

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The general channel is our main interface
where we interact with the system

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Behind the scenes, we have 5 specialized agents:
AgentG - The Coordinator, our single point of contact

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
AgentA - The Historian, collects historical research
AgentB - The Script Planner, designs the story structure

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
AgentC - The Interactive Performer, engages users in creative decisions
AgentD - The Script Writer, produces the final professional script

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, let me input our theme in the general channel:
"Theme: The Peach Blossom Spring"

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Watch what happens... AgentG immediately responds:
"Theme received, AgentA is collecting historical data"

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
AgentA, our historian, springs into action
It's gathering comprehensive historical background

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Including Tao Yuanming's biography from Eastern Jin Dynasty
The historical context of 421 AD

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Social turmoil and escapism themes
Literary analysis and cultural significance

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And there we go! AgentA has published
a comprehensive 1,200-word historical research package

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can see details about the poet, the era
and the meaning behind this utopian story

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now AgentB, our script planner, takes over
Based on the historical research

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's designing a three-act structure:
Act 1 - Fisherman discovers the hidden valley

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Act 2 - Interactions with the utopian villagers
Act 3 - Departure and the failed return

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
AgentB has also created character profiles
mapped out the emotional arcs

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And identified key dramatic moments
This outline is now ready for the interactive phase

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Here's where it gets interesting
The interactive phase with AgentC!

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
AgentC splits the outline into 5 scenes
and asks me to make creative decisions for each one

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Scene 1 appears:
"The fisherman travels along the stream, seeing peach blossoms..."

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Question: How should we portray the fisherman's feelings?
I'll choose option B - attracted by the beauty, decides to explore

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Watch what happens... AgentC receives my choice
and immediately presents Scene 2

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
"The fisherman discovers a narrow opening
He enters and finds a whole new world..."

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This continues for 5 rounds total
Each choice shapes the final script

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Notice how AgentC waits for my response before continuing
This is our innovative 4-layer filtering mechanism

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It ensures strict "one question, one answer" flow
preventing the agent from auto-advancing

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll quickly complete the remaining rounds...
Making choices that shape the narrative

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
After the 5th interaction
AgentD - our script writer - finally speaks!

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Throughout the entire process
AgentD has been silently collecting everything

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The historical research from AgentA
The three-act structure from AgentB

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And all 5 of my creative decisions
Now it integrates all this information

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Into a complete, professional script
And here it is! A 2,600-word theater script

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Including character list with detailed profiles
Scene descriptions and stage directions

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Dialogue for all characters
Psychological descriptions and emotional cues

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Stage lighting and blocking notes
This is production-ready

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So what makes this system special
from a technical perspective?

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
First: Strict Agent Specialization
Each of the 5 agents has a clear role

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And only subscribes to necessary channels
This channel isolation reduces token consumption by over 50%

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Second: State Machine Control
AgentC implements a 4-layer filtering system

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Content validation, Source verification
Marker detection, State consistency check

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This ensures AgentC never advances without user input
Solving a common Multi-Agent challenge

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Third: Silent Collection Pattern
AgentD observes the entire process without interrupting

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Then delivers one high-quality final output
More efficient than constant back-and-forth

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Fourth: Central Coordinator Architecture
AgentG acts as a hub

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Managing all task distribution and result aggregation
Users only interact with one channel - simple and clean

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
These innovations bring token usage
from 500,000+ down to 200,000-300,000 per session

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So that's Historical Traces
A Multi-Agent system for collaborative script creation

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Use cases include: Education - Students experience history interactively
Creative Writing - Rapid professional script generation

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And Cultural Industry - Content for film, theater, and documentaries
The entire codebase is open-source on GitHub

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
